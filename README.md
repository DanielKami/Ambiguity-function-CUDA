# Ambiguity-function-CUDA
This is  super fast ambiguity function created for NVIDIA cards with CUDA technology.

The code was compiled with use of VS2022 for Windows 11

The code uses NVIDIA CUDA FFT as a static library from CUDA 11.8 tolkit
You have to install it first prior to ambiguity compilation. The tolkit is here https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit. It can be necessary to compile your project with correct settings in Project properties e.g. Windows 10/11 version and so on.
For this kit you will need the NEWEST NVIDIA drivers for your graphics card.

Ambiguity DLL library is used by Radar3 program which is also located in my depository
